Physical classroom: Aula L2 - Castro Laurenziano (RM018-E01PTEL026)

There is no virtual classroom, and the lectures will not be recorded.

**Q & A:** We will use a [Discord](https://discord.com/) server. More details during the first lessons.

## Pre-requisites üîë

Python fundamentals; calculus; linear algebra.

## Textbook and reading material üìñ

Due to the continuously evolving nature of the topic, there is no fixed textbook as a reference. Specific material in the form of scientific articles and book chapters will be given throughout the lectures.

In addition, [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2022/raw/main/resources/Course_notes_Crisostomi.pdf) you can find some supplementary course notes.

**Accessibility üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è**: Starting from this semester, in an effort to create a more inclusive and accessible learning environment, all slides have been re-designed with readability in mind to support students with specific learning disabilities. We aim to ensure that everyone, regardless of learning differences, has equal access to the educational content provided. Should you need additional accommodations or have suggestions for further improving accessibility, please feel free to reach out.

## Grading üìä

**Exam dates**
- <s>5 June 2024</s>
- <s>10 July 2024</s>
- <s>10 September 2024</s>

Evaluation proceeds according to the following steps:

- A midterm self-evaluation test (optional, does not concur to the final grade)
- A final written exam (**mandatory**, accounts for 60% of the final grade)
- A project (**mandatory**, accounts for 40% of the final grade)
- An oral exam (optional, attributes at most 3 points, added to or subtracted from the final grade)

We may require an oral exam in doubtful cases or whenever necessary.

- The project list for 2023/2024 is [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2024/raw/main/project_list.pdf).
- The template for the final project report is [here](https://github.com/erodola/DLAI-s2-2024/raw/main/template.zip).
